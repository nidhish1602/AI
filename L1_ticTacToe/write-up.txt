LAB 1: Implement Tic –Tac –Toe Game.
Explanation: The puzzle consists of 9 tiles. The users starts first, then the AI and the games goes on until one of them succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row
Rules for solving the puzzle: Both the users get to place their marks anywhere on the board and the first one to complete a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins. Users need to strategize their moves to give them a higher chance of winning the game. 
How AI plays Tic-Tac-Toe as an opponent:
AI takes the user inputs and remaining empty spaces into consideration and gives the best move. The following functions are used to check and analysis the situation


spaceIsFree checks for empty space
compMove verifies all conditions, like if user won, if not it’ll block the corners and sides
selectRandom is the AI’s move based on compMove
